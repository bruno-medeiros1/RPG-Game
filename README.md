## Introduction

This game was developed for 2D environments, by the process, I could learn a lot about 2D topics, such as **Tile Maps**,  **Sorting Layers**, **Animations**, **User Interface**, **Cinemachine Cameras**, among other things. I also improved my overall skill in scripting, by getting deeper in things like **Event Handlers**, **State Machines** and other techniques.
This project took a lot of self-discipline to finish but it was worth it and satisfying to get more experience as a game developer! :smile:	

----------------------------------------------

## *Game Description* 

This game was inspired by "*Zelda*" one of my all-time favourite games. Since this is an **adventure game**, I decided that would have a simple environment where the player could explore and interact with things before the fighting part starts. 
The player can move by pressing the **`W`**, **`S`**, **`A`**, **`D`** keys.
I wanted that the player could attack with a bowl and arrows, as so, have some special attack, like shooting multiples arrows at a time. This is achievable if the player clicks **`RIGHT-CLICK MOUSE`** but be careful there is a **5s** cooldown for using it.
Finally, when the player starts the ***Boss Mode***, multiples enemies are spawned which the goal is to kill the most of it and try to break the previous record. ***There is an increment of difficulty in each wave***.
